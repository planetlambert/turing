## Overall Thoughts

- Turing essentially invents (in theory) the computer and the concept of software/programming, all in service to solve a math problem.
- It felt as if Turing piled three or four genius insights on-top of one another, so while reading I was never able to get comfortable before he took things to the next level.
- There are a lot of bugs (which makes sense as he was not able to run the machine himself).
- Attempting to learn this paper as a non-mathematician makes me want to get a deeper understanding of the history of math/logic (probably starting with Hilbert, GÃ¶del, etc.)
- The appendix is a great segue to Church's Lambda Calculus, which will probably be my next project.

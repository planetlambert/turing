## TODO

- Complete paper
- Make sure interfaces (for UniversalMachine in particular) look right
    - AbbreviatedTable shouldn't be able to Move, etc.
    - Check pointers, etc.
    - All of `standard.go` should be analyzed, etc.
    - Documentation first?
- Move Repository
- Clean up, document, link and cite Annotated Turing, original paper
